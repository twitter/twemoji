# Contributing Guidelines

Looking to contribute something? Here's how you can help.

## Bugs reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the
repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a reduced test
   case and a live example.

4. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. Include specific
   information about the environment - operating system and version, browser
   and version... and steps required to reproduce the issue.

## Feature requests & contribution enquiries

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case for the inclusion of your feature. Please provide as much detail and
context as possible.

Contribution enquiries should take place before any significant pull request,
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that we might
have good reasons for rejecting.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

Make sure to adhere to the coding conventions used throughout the codebase
(indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test
coverage).

Please follow this process; it's the best way to get your work included in the
project:

1. Create a new topic branch to contain your feature, change, or fix:

2. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Provide clear and explanatory commit
   messages. Use git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

3. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

4. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

5. [Open a Pull Request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) with a
   clear title and description.
